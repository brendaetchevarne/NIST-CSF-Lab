# 🛡️ DDoS Attack Incident Report – Applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, I created a cybersecurity incident report analyzing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targeted a company’s internal network. The main objective was to apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to assess and respond to the incident. This involved identifying vulnerabilities, recommending protective measures, improving detection capabilities, planning an appropriate incident response, and outlining recovery strategies. The exercise demonstrated my ability to apply structured security frameworks in real-world scenarios and propose actionable solutions to strengthen network defenses.
